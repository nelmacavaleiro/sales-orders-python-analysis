# Sales Orders Analysis – Python Fundamentals

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates core Python data analysis skills applied to a real-world sales dataset. It focuses on loading, cleaning, transforming, and analysing sales data to extract meaningful business insights related to revenue, profit, regional performance, and customer segments.

The analysis is performed using pandas and matplotlib and is designed as a portfolio-ready example of end-to-end data analysis in Python.

## Dataset Description
The project uses a sales orders dataset containing **4,117 records** with the following key attributes:
- Order details (Order ID, Order Date, Year)
- Sales representative and geographic information
- Customer segment and product category
- Sales value, item cost, and units sold

Two versions of the dataset are included:
- Raw dataset (original format)
- Clean dataset (used for analysis)

## Key Insights
- **Total Sales:** 1,214,665.00  
- **Total Profit:** 2,049.27  
- **Average Sale Value:** 295.04  
- **Maximum Single Sale:** 6,517.00  
- Sales show consistent growth from 2011 to 2014  
- The **Central region** generates the highest overall profit  
- The **Home Office segment** shows the highest average profit margin  

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Techniques
- CSV data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and type conversion
- Currency value parsing and numeric transformation
- Calculated fields (total cost, profit, profit margin)
- Aggregations using groupby and summary statistics
- Time-based and categorical analysis
- Data visualisation (line and bar charts)

## Files in This Repository
- `sales_orders_analysis.py` – Main Python analysis script  
- `Sales_Orders_Clean.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for analysis  
- `Sales_Orders_Raw.csv` – Original raw dataset  

## Notes
This project was developed as part of a professional data analytics portfolio to demonstrate practical Python skills for business and sales data analysis.
